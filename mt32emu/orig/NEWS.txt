2013-02-11:

	1.1.1 released.

	* Bugfix in mixer. Weird timbres which have ring modulation structures but with only partial were mixed incorrectly.
	  Test timbre: "TinCan1" in Dune2 (completely muted).

2013-01-19:

	1.1.0 released.

	* Refined computations of pulse widths.
	* Removed STL dependency. The only STL class used by mt32emu library now reimplemented as a simplest linked list.
	* Some improvements in mt32emu_win32drv_setup regarding driver cleanup and directory handling.
	* Minor sources cleanup towards easier mt32emu library integration into other applications.

2012-12-25:

	1.0.0 released.

	* Thanks to the reverse engineering efforts of Mok, KingGuppy and SergM various things are now accurate.
	  These include MIDI event processing, time variant pitch, amplifier and filter envelopes, partial allocation, etc.
	* Fixed many inaccuracies in MIDI event processing.
	* Waveforms are now generated on the fly. Waveform cache files are no longer necessary and can be deleted.
	  New waveform generation engine closely resembles LA32 synthesis and demand significantly less computational resources.
	* Ring modulation approach simplified and made accurate.
	* Mixer now approximately resembles the LA32 feature - inverted mixing of partials. This is particularly noticeable
	  for patches containing closely sounding partials which are capable to subtract each other.
	* Added emulation of the data lines shift between the LA32 chip and the DAC.
	* The overall emulation is now close to indistinguishable to a listener.
	* Internal emulation sample rate is fixed to 32000 Hz - LA32 working sample rate. There are plenty of thing bound
	  to this value which can not be easily adapted to sample rate changes and as such, will break the emulation accuracy.
	  An additional resampler is now required to convert the sample rate to any arbitrary value.
	* Added accurate reverberation model of the Boss reverb chip.
	* Changed building tools. CMake is now required to build the library.
	* Removed some obsolete stuff in API (ExternalInterface, SynthProperties struc).
	* Changed report API. A C++ ReportHandler class is now used providing for better convenience.
	* Changed file handling routines. ROM files are now loaded entirely at the initialisation and verified using SHA1 digests.
	  Broken or unknown ROM files cannot be used anymore.

2005-07-04:

	0.1.3 released.

	* Added support for most of the extended capabilities of the CM-32L/LAPC-I (more rhythm timbres, more rhythm key mappings, more PCM samples).
	* The control ROM is now identified by searching for matching ID strings at various locations in the file. There are now a lot of safety checks to help ensure that a bad ROM will not crash the emulator.
	* Three control ROM versions are now identified and mapped out - an original MT-32 control ROM, an original CM-32L ROM, and the Blue Ridge modified MT-32 ROM.
	* Now supports the expression controller properly.
	* Sustain is now turned off correctly again.
	* "All Notes Off" no longer stops notes held by the sustain controller.
	* Implemented "Reset all controllers".
	* Stereo pan positions are no longer inverted.
	* Volume, pitch, filter and envelopes are now more accurately calculated. Overall, the sound emulation is much more accurate.
	* Waveforms are now slightly more accurate (in terms of pitch), necessitating a regeneration.
	* Handling of unusual sysex messages has been improved (fixes sysex messages from Java's MIDI classes on Windows).
	* Fixed a reverb bug during periods of silence.
	* Master tuning is now properly initialised to 0x4A (442Hz).
