DOSBox for Debian
-----------------

*WARNING*

dosbox provides access to your local filesystem. This is one of its
core features, but specially crafted DOS applications can abuse this
feature.

DOSBox's configfiles are never backwards compatible. If you run into
errors please remove your configfile and see if it helps.

When mounting cdroms (on the host/not in dosbox), specify the unhide option
if you run into problems.
